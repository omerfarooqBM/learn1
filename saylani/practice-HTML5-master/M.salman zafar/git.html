	<h1>What is git?</h1>
	<h3 style="color:red">Git Basics</h3>
	<font size="4">
	Whether you are a professional or an amateur developer, you've likely heard about
	the concept of version control. You may know that adding a new feature, fixing
	broken ones, or stepping back to a previous condition is a daily routine.
	<br><br>
	There are many tools for this job on the market, both proprietary and open source.
	Usually, you will find Version Control Systems (VCS) and Distributed Version
	Control Systems (DVCS). Some examples of centralized tools are Concurrent
	Version System (CVS), Subversion (SVN), Team Foundation Server (TFS) and
	Perforce, while in DVCS, you can find Bazaar, Mercurial, and Git. The main
	difference between the two families is the constraint—in the centralized system—to
	have a remote server where get and put your files; if the network is down, you are in
	trouble. In DVCS instead, you can have or not a remote server (even more than one),
	but you can work offline, too. All your modifications are locally recorded so that you
	can sync them some other time. Today, Git is the DVCS that has gained public favor
	more than others, growing quickly from a niche tool to mainstream.</font><br>

	<h3 style="color:red">The Three States</h3>
	<font size="4" >Now, pay attention. This is the main thing to remember about Git if you want the rest of 
	your learning process to go smoothly. Git has three main states that your files can reside in: 
	committed, modified, and staged. Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database. 
	Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet. 
	Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit 
	snapshot. This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project: the Git directory, the working 
	directory, and the staging area. Working directory, staging area, and Git directory.
	<br>
	The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. 
	This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository
	from another computer.<br>
	The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of 
	the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.
	The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about 
	what will go into your next commit. Its sometimes referred to as the <strong>index</strong> but its also common to 
	refer to it as the staging area.
	The basic Git workflow goes something like this:
	<ol>
	    <li style="color:blue">You modify files in your working directory.</li>
		<li style="color:blue">You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.</li>
		<li style="color:blue">You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory</li>
	</ol><font size="4">
